Metrics vs Monitoring

🔹 What are Metrics?

Metrics are measurements or data points that provide information about a system’s performance.

✅ Examples of metrics:

CPU usage

Memory consumption

Network traffic

Number of requests per second

Metrics help track what is happening in a system at any given time.


🔹 What is Monitoring?

Monitoring is the continuous process of observing metrics over time to detect trends, anomalies, and failures.

✅ Monitoring involves:

Collecting and storing metrics

Setting thresholds for alerts

Analyzing trends for better decision-making

📌 Example: Tracking CPU usage daily is a metric, but setting an alert when CPU usage goes above 80% is monitoring.


What is Prometheus?

🔹 Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system that collects metrics from different sources and stores them in a time-series database.

Key Features:

✅ Collects real-time metrics from servers, applications, and Kubernetes clusters.
✅ Stores data in a time-series format (with timestamps).
✅ Provides a query language (PromQL) to retrieve and analyze data.
✅ Sends alerts using Alertmanager when specific conditions are met.
✅ Works efficiently in Kubernetes environments.

How It Works?

1️⃣ Scrapes metrics from various sources via HTTP endpoints.\
2️⃣ Stores metrics in its database.
3️⃣ Analyzes data using PromQL.
4️⃣ Triggers alerts based on predefined rules.

📌 Example: Prometheus can track CPU usage of a Kubernetes pod and send an alert if it exceeds a limit.


What is Grafana?

🔹 Grafana is an open-source visualization tool used to create dashboards for analyzing metrics and logs.

Key Features:

✅ Connects with multiple data sources (Prometheus, InfluxDB, MySQL, etc.).
✅ Provides real-time dashboards for monitoring system health.
✅ Allows custom alerts via email, Slack, and other tools.
✅ Supports role-based access control (RBAC) for security.
✅ Helps in troubleshooting and capacity planning.

How It Works?

1️⃣ Connects to a data source (e.g., Prometheus).
2️⃣ Fetches metrics and visualizes data as graphs, charts, and tables.
3️⃣ Helps in real-time monitoring and trend analysis.

📌 Example: If Prometheus collects CPU usage metrics, Grafana can display a graph of CPU usage over time.
